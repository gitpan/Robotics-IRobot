Robotics-IRobot

Robotics::IRobot provides an interface for controlling and accessing
sensor data from iRobot robots that support the OI Interface.

This module provides on object oriented interface to the robot and allows
for both event-driven and polling-based reading of sensor data. It provides
all functionality defined in the OI Interface for Roomba 400 series and
Create robots. Also provided is some additional functionality such as
primative dead reckoning and enhanced use of the Create's song
functionality.

Currently this module will only run on linux systems.  This is
because of a requirement on Device::SerialPort.  In the future,
it may support windows systems via Win32::SerialPort.
